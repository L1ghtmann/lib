/**

 * within a preference bundle, and bug fixes for common issues within the
 * Settings app and Preferences framework. In particular,a bug with the list
 * controller's content disappearing after closing the Settings app and opening
 * it again is worked around, as well as an issue on iOS 7 where in some cases
 * a cell may stay highlighted after being tapped.
 *
 * It includes two class methods you can override to return the name of a
 * Preferences specifier property list, and a tint color for the interactable
 * elements within the list controller.
