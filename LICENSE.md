### SaurikIT
* Cydia Substrate: Licensing is rather strange and unclear here.
    * As of approximately version 0.9.3997, Cydia Substrate became closed source. It was previously GNU GPL v3.
    * The header provided here is taken from Cydia Substrate 0.9.4001 (February 2013) and has a comment that indicates that it is licensed under [GNU LGPL v3](CydiaSubstrate.framework/Headers/CydiaSubstrate.h).
    * Cydia Substrate 0.9.5000 (December 2013) changed the license comment to GNU GPL v3. It is unclear why this has changed.
